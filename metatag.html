<p>each paragraph must be related to that idea. In other words, your paragraphs should remind 
    your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your thesis and the information in each paragraph. 
    A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow. The whole process is 
    an organic one—a natural progression from a seed to a full-blown paper where there are direct, familial relationships
     between all of the ideas in the paper.

    The decision about what to put into your paragraphs begins with the germination of a seed of ideas; this “germination process” is better known as brainstorming. There are many techniques for brainstorming; whichever one you choose, this stage of paragraph development cannot be skipped. Building paragraphs can be like building a skyscraper: there must be a well-planned foundation that supports what you are building. 
    Any cracks, inconsistencies, or other corruptions of the foundation can cause your whole paper to crumble.</p>
